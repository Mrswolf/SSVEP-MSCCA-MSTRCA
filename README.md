# SSVEP-MSCCA-MSTRCA

This demo shows an example of using multi-stimulus canonical correlation analysis (MS-CCA) and multi-stimulus ensemble task-related component analysis (MS-eTRCA) SSVEP recognition. Besides, the extended CCA (eCCA) and the traditional eTRCA are also provided for comparison study.

For the above algorithms, please refer the following papers for more details:

ms-CCA: Wong, C. M., et al. (2019). Learning across multi-stimulus enhances target recognition methods in SSVEP-based BCIs. Journal of neural engineering.

ms-eTRCA: Wong, C. M., et al. (2019). Learning across multi-stimulus enhances target recognition methods in SSVEP-based BCIs. Journal of neural engineering.

eCCA: Chen, X., et al. (2015). High-speed spelling with a noninvasive brainî“œcomputer interface. Proceedings of the national academy of sciences, 112(44), E6058-E6067.

eTRCA: Nakanishi, M., et al. (2017). Enhancing detection of SSVEPs for a high-speed brain speller using task-related component analysis. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 65(1), 104-112.

In this example, most parameters (such as number of harmonics, time-window lengths and number of neighboring templates) can be adjusted manually to explore their effects on the final performance
